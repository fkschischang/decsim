WARNING: This code makes heavy use of compiler directives and is known to not function correctly with GCC versions older than GCC 13.3. To ensure correct functionality, you can verify the results against the Julia language references [hosc-Julia](https://github.com/applecoffeecake/hosc-Julia) and [mc-hosc-Julia](https://github.com/applecoffeecake/mc-hosc-Julia) which completely model the encoding, transmission, and decoding in the unterminated case. Simulation of the unterminated case can be emulated with the C programs by sending one frame (with -f 1) with the size of the frame set to be the number of blocks/rectangles that you wish to transmit. This corresponds to the number of trials in the Julia language references. Error rates should agree between the two with the Julia runs taking significantly longer than the C runs. Alternatively, you can verify results against our [published simulations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.13415).
